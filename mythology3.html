            I believe that generally the Gods are concerned with their own self-interest while mostly choosing to favor or not favor humans based on their extraordinary disposition, grudges and lineage.  When Athene and Hera take the Achaians side in the Trojan War because of Paris choosing Aphrodite as the most beautiful God it seems that the Gods aren’t concerned with the welfare of the humans but they are concerned with what will give them the most clout.  Circe and Kalypso favor Odysseus because they give him sexual pleasure and they wish to keep him for their own.  The Gods Zeus and Athene seem to favor Odysseus just because he is a human with extraordinary ability but seem to not really care about his crew.   The favorability that is shown with Odysseus from the Gods on many occasions leads you believe that the disposition and plight of non-divinities is partially to be the cause of favorability with the Gods as Odysseus is a very noble human with an incredible back story.  As many of Odysseus’s crew gets killed with no one caring but Odysseus, you can see that the Gods care little for typical humans and their losses is not something that is given too much thought.  During the Iliad, many regular humans die for a war that is seemingly caused by Aphrodite so she can have the claim as the most beautiful of the Gods.  So, one can conclude that she may not care about humans as much as the main epic heroes of the story.

            The Gods seem to uphold what is right for both sides when they don’t necessarily have a favorite, however.  When Achilles is defiling Hektor’s body the god Apollo protects it and makes sure it eventually sees a proper burial.  This shows you that the gods are not always only concerned with their own self-interest but also are concerned with the dignity and righteousness of the humans for which they govern.  Along this story line you see Athene and Zeus supporting Odysseus even though there is no sex or seemingly nothing in it for them at all.

                It seems like the best way to get a meaningful divinity on your side is to have a divinity in your lineage.  This seems to be somewhat of trump card when it comes to having the ultimately winning relationships of divinities on your side.  You see this in both the cases of Thetis and Achilles and Poseidon and Polyphemos.  Although there are other Gods taking sides during these plights, these relationships with the Gods with certain lineages seem to be the most crucial. Achilles relationship with Thetis (along with the prophecy that he will die if fights with the Achains) seem to be swaying the war in favor of the Trojans.  Polyphemos’s relationship with Poseidon is what prevents Odysseus from return home with his men. The Aiolos conclude that the only way this could’ve gone wrong for the Odysseus’ crew is that the Gods are looking at the Ithacans unfavorably.  Through this experience, you can conclude that the curses from the Gods can be a determining factor in the plight of the epic heroes.

                The plight of characters is also important to win favorability with the Gods. Athene intervenes multiple times to save her favorite non-divinities. First, she intervenes to save Agamemnon from Achilles when she promises him he will be rewarded for letting Agamemnon live.  Secondly, she intervenes to save Odysseus from certain death at the hands of Poseidon and again when he runs into trouble with the suitors.  You also see divinities strike vengeance on those that disobey their warnings prophecies or messages.  You see this when Aigisthos is warned by Hermes not to have an affair with Agamemnon’s wife, yet does so anyway and when Odysseus’ men eat the Helios’ sacred cattle.  In both cases, death of the characters that violate these warnings is justifiable by the Gods.  Justifiable homicide in the eyes of the Gods is something that you see semi often.  Athene (still supporting Odysseus) encourages and even demands that Odysseus kill the suitors that intend to marry his wife Penelope.  When you fool around with a hero’s wife, when you violate something sacred, and when the opposition has a divinity in their lineage are the seeming surefire ways of getting a divinity to hold a grudge against you.
