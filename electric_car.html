            Electronic vehicles are the next step in tackling many problems facing Americans today.  These issues include the economy, the war on terror, rising gas prices and the environment.  These are problems that concern everyday Americans like you and me and the electric car is a possible solution to all of them.  Electric cars are a seemingly no-brainer to the advancement of American culture as they are more energy efficient, would decrease American dependency on foreign oil, and are more beneficial to the environment than internal combustion engines.  The electric car has developed into models that cost less for the consumer, and are more stylish in appearance then previous models.  Although many people state that electricity must be made through the burning of coal, and the damage to the environment would be equivalent to that of burning gasoline; America as a nation is more able to develop the renewable resources at our disposal through the use of wind energy, geothermal energy, hydrogen energy, ocean energy, and bioenergy.  As American society and the societies of the world are becoming more technologically advanced, the time to make the switch from the internal combustion engines of the past to the electric models of the future is now.

            As America struggles with its dependency on foreign oil, electrical powered engines may be the next step in solving that issue.  Oil is a main import for the United States and contributes to the increasing deficit in the trade gap.  America spends almost a billion dollars a day overseas on oil, pouring money into countries with unstable governments.  As shown in the chart below, a vast amount of oil that is imported is imported from foreign countries that are unstable.

                If the United States were able to spend that money at home it could potentially help eliminate many of the major domestic issues facing our country today. The outstanding national debt of the United States, totaled at approximately 15 trillion dollars, has the potential to burden America for generations to come.   Spending this money at the homeland would go a long way to eliminating this debt but it would also help eliminate the funding to unstable regimes overseas as well.  Unstable governments lead to conflicts in which the United States almost inevitably plays a role.  The United States dependency on oil drives up the price of oil across the world.  Indirectly the United States are giving countries we are at war with, like Iran, more value for their oil.  If America were able to cut back on its oil dependence then it would be beneficial to world peace in general.

                As electric cars would benefit the United States foreign relations, they would also be beneficial to the environment.  Nuclear power plants fuel electric cars.  A power plant offers a clean energy alternative that frees us from fossil fuel dependence.  Through internal combustion engines the United States produces about one fourth of the world’s carbon emissions.  For every liter of gasoline you burn in an internal combustion engine your car emits 2.4 kg of CO2 in the air.  Experts predict that the amount of cars on the road will double to roughly 1,000,000,000 cars in 2020.  There is some speculation on whether the planet is getting hotter but without a doubt the ozone layer is shrinking.  If in switching from the internal combustion engines to electrical engines we as planet could make the transition from nonrenewable resources like oil, to renewable resources such as: wind, solar and water.  Making the switch to electric powered cars is the next step in making the planet a more eco-friendly place.

                Although electric cars may appeal to the environment as well as foreign policy, with their sluggish appearance and high cost there really weren’t a whole lot of incentives for people to buy electric.  Recently, however, the cars cost is becoming affordable to the everyday America and their appearance has come a long from the original models.  Pictured below is a picture of the new 2012 Chevrolet Volt.

                Not only does the new Chevy Volt look like a car America would want to own, it is also cost-efficient, costing approximately $31,645.  Previous electric cars would cost in the neighborhood of $90,000 to $100,000 and really wouldn’t look like a car that the average American would want to own.  The picture below shows the 1997 GM EV1.

                    Although not a bad looking car, it’s not a car that makes the consumer say, “Wow, I want to have this.”  Since the new electric car looks cool, it looks like something America would want to own, it takes the next step in becoming the what’s next in the auto-industry.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class= col-md-12 style= "text-indent: 75px">
                <p style="line-height: 2;">
                    Although America as a nation is capable of producing nuclear power plants as a clean energy alternative to fossil fuels, the United States is growing more and more capable of producing natural renewable resources.  Once established renewable resources can be a cost efficient, clean alternative to fossil fuels.  “Renewable sources can cost less than consuming the local electrical supply. In the long run, the prices of electricity are expected to soar since they are based on the prices of crude oil, so renewable sources can cut your electricity bills.”

            <div class= col-md-12 style= "text-indent: 75px">
                <p style="line-height: 2;">
                    In conclusion, the electric car is what’s next in the auto-industry.  Helping solve American problems such as current gas prices, the struggling economy, the unrest in the Middle East as well as environmental issues, the electric car is the logical answer to many questions draining the United States.  The appearance and cost of the electric car are coming down and compared to gasoline-powered cars, the fuel price is menial compared to that of internal combustion powered engines.    This turns the burden the American consumer, are they ready to make this step, not only just for themselves, but for the children of future generations whom which they affect?
