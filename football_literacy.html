                    Football throughout the United States is a major social activity.  It is easy to cheer for your favorite team and dislike the opponent.  Growing up in certain regional areas of the country, you are almost raised to cheer for one team and despise another.  My dad grew up in Cleveland and grew up a Browns fan so I naturally I grew up watching and cheering for the Browns and jeering the hated Steelers, Bengals, and Ravens.  By watching my favorite teams, as well as playing throughout my childhood, I picked up many of the plays and unique differences from other games that many Americans are familiar with.  I learned basic things such as the rules and football terminology by watching and being around the game throughout my childhood.  I know you get four downs to move the football ten yards forward and obtain a first down.  I know the various types of fouls for which penalties are given, and that each team is allowed to have eleven players on both sides of the ball.  I picked up basic terminology like screen, draw, zone coverage, man to man coverage, turnover, interception, and fumble.  I learned that as scripted as the game tends to be sometimes, it is just as much a game of improvising and teamwork. You need to have your teammates back, and they need to have your back because mistakes are going to happen and a lot of times teammates end up covering each other’s assignments.  There is no real way to describe how I picked up the football terminology but I feel that just growing up in America helped me become literate in the great game of football.  Also, however, by being a part of a team and playing the game for as long as I did, I learned many things that were helpful in the game of football and many other things that are pivotal in the game of life.

                    When I first started playing football, I was in fourth grade.  As a class at St. Michael’s grade school in Worthington, Ohio, we would always play football at recess on the blacktop.  This was not only a social activity where I met and made friends but this also exposed me to football for the first time.  The field at recess was a blacktop about 40 yards long with two lampposts marking each end zone and recess was always the best part of the day.  It may have only been 15 minutes long but I got everything possible out of those 15 minutes.  Every day I can remember coming in from recess with my face reddened, my white school polo soaked in sweat, and absolutely exhausted from exercise.  These recess experiences are probably what prompted me to go out for football in fourth grade.  Getting started playing football so early in fourth grade helped me grow into a great football fan and player.  As years passed, from playing football and watching teams like the Browns and Buckeyes, I picked up terminology and became more involved in the football community.  There was always a certain toughness associated with football and I think that’s part of what drew me to it.  Everyone I grew up playing football with has this sense of toughness gained from playing football.  We can look back on the sprints we ran, the fourth quarters we went through together, and the two-a-day practices we went through with each other and have this sense of toughness that not a lot of other groups of people can say they have.

                        As high school progressed the experiences we shared with each other and bonds we had grown with each other were displayed through various gestures.  The football community has many different rituals and signs they share with each other.  Before every game our team would sprint out of the tunnel and meet jumping up and down in a circle as one person yelled, “Any dogs in the house?” 
                                To which we yelled back, “Woof! Woof!!”
                                This was followed by a, “What time is it?” from the original speaker.
                                The team then replied back, “Game Time!”
                        This was a ritual that represented togetherness.  We showed the other team that we were ready for whatever they wanted to throw at us.  More hooting and hollering, as well as handshakes always followed this ritual.  My teammate and I had a traditional handshake that particularly got us fired up and displayed a strong front while the other team anxiously looked on.  We would both slightly bend our knees then slap our right hands followed by a slap of the left hands.  We would then jump up in the air and roll off of each other’s back.  It was cool.  It was fresh.  As a team, we knew how hard we worked and that we deserved it.   We were all there in our moment and we were intimidating.  It was quite the experience.

                        Along with being a part of the football community, I have gained knowledge about the game that I definitely would not have obtained without actually playing the game.  I learned that individual players don’t make a team.  Throughout the years the guys I worked with and the guys that I practiced with became a crutch on the field.  I relied on them and they relied on me to pick up the slack on some of the missed assignments.  Being a contain guy for my team in the state championship game, my responsibility on running plays was to not let anyone get to the boundary of the field.   I recall a play when the other team was driving and about to score and I got caught looking inside on a play that initially started inside.  The running back made a sharp cut and bounced outside.  As he <!-- crossed my face and --> was about to break a big run, one of my teammates came flying in to make the tackle.  Not only did I feel relieved because I did not let my teammates down, I also knew my teammates had my back.  This is a skill that will not only help you in sports but will also help you become successful in life.  If you are a person that can be trusted and a person that is helpful to others in general, then life will treat you well and you will have many friends.  I believe through sports, in general, this sense of trust can be developed.  As a kid it’s great to be involved in sports because of the relationships you gain and the experiences you have throughout the rest of your life.

                        I learned the importance of playing with momentum and how mental the game is.  A team that plays with confidence and “swagger” and plays with a chip on its shoulder will often times beat a more talented team.  When we were playing DeSales there was definitely a lot of pressure for us to win.  Growing up watching some of the great Watterson versus DeSales games, you realize how great the history of the series is.  These are two schools with football programs that consistently reach the playoffs year in and year out.  This game is like Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier fighting for the heavy weight title.   The game is almost always a toss-up and is decided by a field goal or a single touchdown each year. The past few seasons the cards had not been in Watterson’s favor and DeSales currently held a five-game winning streak.  This season in particular, they were a powerhouse again with all sorts of big time division one players and talented athletes.  We had seen other grades before, really talented classes, come up short or start off strong only to falter when the game was on the line.  We knew if we got our shot to play in this big game we weren’t going to disappoint.

                        The atmosphere that night was electric.  We might’ve only been playing in front of a few thousand people but it felt like we were playing on Monday Night Football.  The lights were bright, the stage was big, and the crowd was loud.  We came out and played fired up from the get go.  We were vocal with each other and gave each other encouragement throughout the game.  Constantly, throughout the game, we were reminding each other what was at stake.  It all happened so fast.  The game was a blur of emotion.  All of sudden I looked up at the scoreboard and we were up 31-0, just like that.  The game that night was if Tyson fought an infant.  I remember coming off the field with a huge grin on my face as I was walking up and down the sideline, shaking my head in disbelief.  It was about what we did as a team.  How we did something that was bigger than all of us.  How we had stuck together and how far we had come.  All the hard work we put in had finally paid off and we had achieved greatness.  When I look back on that night, chills run down my spine.

                    <p style="line-height: 2;">
                        The attitude and confidence we played with that night can be applied to life as well.  I believe people can sense confidence.  The confidence and good attitude of people can rub off on others and impact others positively.  Sports are one of the ways you can develop a sense of confidence and a good attitude.  Many people who play sports as children can really gain the confidence that comes with friendship and unity within a group.  Groups like football teams are exclusive and require a team mentality, an excellent work ethic, and a sense of toughness that is required in few other sports.

                        These experiences all tie into how great it is to be a member of a team and how much sports can impact a kid’s life.  They give kids a moment to feel like they’re on top of the world.  This incredible feeling, however, cannot be achieved without hard work and dedication.   With the football season being as long as it is, it is sometimes easy to become complacent.  Practices can sometimes become sloppy; as players aren’t hustling as they should be or are just going through the motions instead of practicing sharp.  After a long day of school, it can be easy for a team to practice without communication and without noise.  Football helped me understand how necessary good preparation is and how it is important to avoid these situations.  It is important to work to avoid becoming complacent.  Going into the final week of the season we were playing a really tough football team- in my opinion one of the toughest we had played all year.  They had beaten some really great football teams, were coming off a huge win against a rival, and were playing for a #1 seed in their region.  We had just clinched the #1 seed in our region and won our division.  There was talk about resting our starters for the playoffs but we wanted to make a statement.  We wanted to show everyone how ready for the playoffs we were.

                        It is about a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Bishop Watterson High School to Lake High School.  This is part of what makes road games like this so difficult.  Getting off a long bus ride like that can leave you tired and groggy.  Staying focused for that period of time is difficult.  Unlike the DeSales game, only a handful of our fans made the trip to the game, while their bleachers were practically full.  The electric atmosphere from the DeSales game was gone and a nighttime fog had descended upon the field and gave the game an almost eerie feel.  The fresh and clean turf was unlike anything I had experienced as a football player.  This was not our territory; we were intruders in a foreign land.  I don’t think anyone saw the massive uppercut we were about to give that team.  We went into their house and really put a licking on them.  The final score was 38-13 and it wasn’t even close.  This game would set the tone for the rest of the playoffs.  
                    </p>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;">
                        The lesson I learned through this experience can be applied to life as well.  Whatever work or profession you’re in it can be easy to become complacent at times.  Sports teach you the lesson that hard work and consistency will pay off and teams that work together will always achieve more than teams that are made up of individuals. I learned a lot about the game of football but the more important lessons were those that I learned about the game of life.    
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p style="line-height: 2;">
                        Another lesson I learned through football was that of perseverance.  Our coach harped on how perseverant our team was throughout the season and it was true.  We had kids playing hurt throughout the season.  One kid was playing with a broken wrist and a club on his hand, and another could hardly walk yet he was quarterbacking our team in the playoffs.  There were games where we were losing and we showed the perseverance and will to win those games.  Just about everyone on our team came up with timely, pivotal plays in big games that helped us achieve the success that we did.  This shows how we all worked together as a team to achieve victory.  Everybody bought in and we couldn’t have achieved what we achieved without all eleven guys on the field.  All the hard work we put into the season paid off and as a group we all have state championship rings to show for it.  This is a feat that not many people can say they have accomplished and to be a part of the exclusive group of state championship athletes requires determination, perseverance, and heart.
