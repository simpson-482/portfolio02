            A coral reef generally refers to a marine ecosystem.  Although sometimes mistaken for plants or rocks, coral reefs are classified under the animal kingdom.  According to scientific classification, coral reefs fall under the phylum Cnidaria and are relatives of jellyfish and anemones.  Corals share two common qualities with other Cnidaria.  They both have a gastro vascular internal system (simple stomach) and a ring of tentacles.  (Corals, 2)  They have no central nervous system (Corals, 2).  Corals are a system of individual yet genetically identical coral polyps.  Corals are classified into two categories:  hard corals and soft corals.  Calcium carbonate skeletons hold together large quantities of coral polyps or hard corals.  Hard corals are the primary reef-building corals (Corals, 2).  Soft corals are characteristically colorful, free moving objects that appear to be plants.  Soft corals do not build the reef structure but may be a part of the coral system.  Soft corals usually form in sets of eight and are often called octocorals. “Though they don't secrete calcium carbonate as prolifically as hard corals, they do contain spiny skeletal elements called sclerites in the cells on the outside of the colony.  Sclerites are found in the jelly-like tissue, called coenenchyme, between polyps.  Sclerites are made of protein and calcium carbonate and give soft coral support to allow them to achieve their vertical structures. The sclerites also give their surfaces a spiky or grainy texture. The inner core of the colony consists of gorgonin; a flexible, fibrous wood-like protein. This gives the soft coral colony the ability to flex with the ocean waves and currents.” (Corals, 2)

            Coral reefs are formed when reef organisms produce enough calcium carbonate to provide the reef structure.  The coral reef community lives only on the surface veneer of the reef, on top of the skeletal material left behind by previous inhabitants of the reef (Kleypas, 3).  Processes are constantly working to break down the skeletal material of the reef.  These processes include erosion in the form of waves and currents as well as erosion in the form of bio-erosion.  The bio-eroders that break down the skeletal material of the coral reef include sponges and parrotfish as well as smaller organisms such as algae and fungi.  Calcium carbonate is the main component of coral reefs and is recycled frequently.  Since coral reefs are only formed when more calcium carbonate is added than lost, some coral reef communities grow too slowly to form a reef. (Kleypas, 3)

                Coral polyps and zooxanthellae have a symbiotic relationship and are two main components of coral reefs.  The zooxanthellae photosynthesize and provide the coral polyps with a fixed source of carbon compounds for energy, enhance calcification, and mediate elemental nutrient flux.  They also help the coral polyp remove wastes.  In return the coral polyps provide a protected environment for the zooxanthellae and they provide the zooxanthellae with plenty of carbon dioxide to photosynthesize.  This symbiotic relationship allows the slow-growing corals to grow in the day by photosynthesis and by night through predation.  Through this process they can coexist with the faster growing algae (Buchheim, 1).  Zooxanthellae and coral reefs work together to produce the right amount of energy to work at max productivity.  If there is less sunlight then the zooxanthellae will produce more chloroplasts.  In contrast if sunlight is intense, then the zooxanthellae may produce less chloroplasts or the coral may expel some of its zooxanthellae in order to maintain homeostasis.  A product of the symbiotic relationship between zooxanthellae and corals is the color that is so radiant in coral reefs.  Inside each square inch of each coral are approximately several million zooxanthellae algae. These zooxanthellae give the coral a color that is anywhere from golden-yellow to brown (Corals, 2).

                Coral reefs are found in a wide variety of locations on our planet.  Coral reefs are very unique compared to other ecosystems and require specific conditions in order to thrive.  Coral reefs are a less common ecosystem because they require shallow water, tropical or sub-tropical regions, and very warm current in order to flourish.  The ideal conditions for reef-building structures are temperature ranges from approximately 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit, clear water with plenty of sunlight, and water that is approximately 70-90 feet deep.  Growth rates in other temperature ranges and deeper water tend to be slower.  In mostly all cases deeper waters not enough light penetrates to the depths to photosynthesize the coral reefs zooxantheallae.   Coral reefs that photosynthesize need tropical latitudes or areas where warm ocean currents flow into tropical areas.  The world’s major coral reefs are located in the Florida Keys, the Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica, in the Pacific Ocean near the Hawaiian Islands, in the Java Sea in Indonesia the Western Indian Ocean, and a portion of the South Pacific Ocean.  Non-tropical regions of coral reef life include the Red Sea, and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef.  The surrounding desert climate of the Red Sea gives it the necessary heat to produce the coral reef climate.  Australia’s Great Barrier Reef gets its source of heat from the tropical Pacific Ocean current.   There are currently over 800 known species of reef-building corals and advances in science are consistently leading to the finding of new species of deep-water corals (Corals).

                The animal life in coral reefs is extremely diverse.  The variety of coral polyps provides the foundation for coral reefs.   Although coral reefs occupy less than 0.015% of the ocean floor, they provide life for about 25% of all marine species.  Of the 34 recognized animal phyla 32 are found in coral reefs (Corals, 2).  Coral reefs support over 800 species of hard corals and over 4,000 species of fish (Corals, 2).  The wide varieties of species that have found a home in coral reefs include the following:  fish, crabs, shrimp, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates, cnidarians, and sea-grasses.  Coral reefs account for approximately 110,000 square miles of ocean floor.  If placed side-by-side, coral reefs would occupy an area slightly larger than the state of Texas.  Because the life in coral reefs is so diverse, they are often referred to as the rainforests of the sea.

                Although most of the world’s coral reefs are found in shallow water, there are certain coral systems that are found in deep-sea conditions.  These corals do not have zooxantheallae because they do not rely on sunlight for life.  They are located on continental shelves, canyons, slopes, and seamounts anywhere from 50 meters in depth to 3,000 meters deep.   These coral systems exhibit a high biodiversity like shallow water corals.  Deep-sea corals are more relevant than previously thought.  Advances in science are leading to the mapping and discovering of more and more deep-sea habitats. (Corals, 2)

                Coral reefs are a very fragile ecosystem.  They are very sensitive to environmental change and disturbance.  Although some of these disturbances are natural, some are caused by human activity.  When the coral reef environment is disturbed bleaching occurs.  Bleaching is the loss of the zooxanthellae in the corals.  As the corals lose their zooxanthellae, over time they transform from a wide array of corals that make coral reefs such a special sight into a pale white.  If the stress put on coral reefs is not too severe and decreases over time, then the coral will regain its zooxanthellae in matter of a few weeks or months.  If the stress is elongated, the coral polyp will eventually die.  The Changes in seawater temperature, increased amounts of ocean acidification, blast fishing, cyanide fishing for aquarium fish, over use of reef resources, agricultural runoff and water pollution all contribute to the bleaching of coral reefs.  These are all factors that can lead to coral reef bleaching.  If a multiple of these factors is working on coral reefs at once then it can be potentially devastating for the reef population.  (Buchheim) As of 2008, approximately 27 percent of reef-building structures are listed as threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.   An additional 20 percent are listed as near threatened or are expected to join the threatened list sometime in the near future (Corals, 2.

            <p style="line-height: 2;">
                Coral reefs have numerously many positive contributions.  Healthy coral reef systems shield the coastlines from storms and protect the coasts from erosion (Corals, 2).  Approximately 9 to 12 percent of the world’s fisheries are contained in coral reefs (Corals, 2).  Medicines found in animals that live in coral reefs have been found to induce and ease labor, treat cancer, arthritis, ulcers, asthma, human bacterial infections, heart disease, viruses, and other diseases (Corals, 2). They are also a good source of nutritional supplements, enzymes, and cosmetics (Corals, 2).  Coral reefs have been referred to as the medical cabinets of the world.  Coral reefs support tourism and help boast the economy.  Scuba divers anxious to see these fascinating specimens dive into coral reefs millions of times each year.  Beaches, protected by coral reefs, are visited by a countless number of tourists each year.  Local economies receive billions of dollars each year by way of fishing trips, hotels, diving tours, restaurants, and other reef based businesses (Corals, 2).
