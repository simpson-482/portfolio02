            Major Themes of Homer’s Book 1 and Book 2
        </p>
        <p class= col-md-12 style= "text-indent: 75px; line-height: 2">
            One theme or issue of Book 1 is the quarrel between humans that ultimately lead to intervention from the Gods.  These interventions from the Gods are seemingly somewhat crucial in maintaining victory or the upper hand in the war.  Another theme involving Agamemnon seems to be that he is somewhat flawed and a tragic hero of this story.  As Agamemnon ignores Achilles’s power along with his connections with Gods you start to see him lose the upper hand in the battle with the Trojans.  This feud is one that is crucial in the war and it remains to be seen if Achilles temporary departure from the war will ultimately cost the Achaians the victory.  The first mortal feud that ultimately leads to a divine intervention is with Chryses and Agamemnon.  In Agamemnon’s struggle to maintain control of what Agamemnon calls his possession in Chryses’s daughter, Chryseis, he ultimately creates a few enemies.  When Agamemnon refuses to give up the possession of Chryseis, you see the theme of Book 1 in the intervention, wrath and punishment from the Gods. This time the God that intervenes is Apollo as he casts a nine-day plague upon the Greeks.   Following along this story line, you see more intervention from the Gods when Athene places herself in the middle of the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon.   She tells Achilles not to kill Agamemnon and that he will be paid over three times for letting Agamemnon take his lady or possession of Briseis.  Agamemnon not only loses his best warrior in this struggle with Achilles but he also loses the crucial and fatal favor with the Gods.  Without the support of the Gods, one can easily assume that that is the side that will lose the war.  The last intervention of the Gods in Book 1 is when Thetis, Achilles mother, intervenes to sway Zeus to help the Trojans win the war after Achilles is betrayed by Agamemnon.  Finally, the last theme, which is that of honor and respect or kleos, is what both Agamemnon and Achilles fear they will lose if he should give up his possession.  For the time being Achilles chooses to forgo kleos in favor of living a longer life and seeing the Achaians falter because of his feud with Agamemnon.

            In Book 2 you see the theme of the intervention or wrath of the Gods when Zeus sends a dream to Agamemnon letting him know that they will sack Troy and that Achaians must attack the city in full force.  Agamemnon, who once again is a seemingly naïve and flawed leader, believes the dream to be true and proceeds to tell his generals about the dream. Next you see Athene in another divine intervention. Athene intervenes to stop Agamemnon’s army from leaving the battlefield as she, along with Hera, are two of the Gods that still favor the Achaians in the Trojan War.  These interventions show you the sides that the Gods are currently on and show you who will most likely win the war.  One can safely assume for now that the side with Zeus on it can and will win the war as Homer states that Agamemnon prays to Zeus for victory in battle but Zeus fails to answer his prayers.

                Book 2 advances from Book 1 in that Achilles strength in battle (along with his favor from the Gods) is transferred from Thetis to Zeus.  Zeus then in turn tricks Agamemnon into thinking that he will be able to conquer Troy if he attacks immediately and with full force.  You see the structure of Gods taking place and you start to see the advancement of which God is on which side.  Zeus, Apollo, and Aphrodite being on the Trojan’s side, while Athene and Hera still heavily favoring the Achaians.  This structure of the Gods (along with Achilles choosing not fight for now) looks like it is shaping up to favor the Trojans.  It seems this way because Zeus favors the Trojans because of the wrath of Achilles.  When Agamemnon prays to Zeus, Zeus doesn’t respond favorably. Whether Agamemnon’s tragic flaws will be worked out and if he can settle his quarrel with Achilles remains to be seen, but for now, the war looks to have shifted in favor of the Trojans.
